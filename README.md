# Space Battle Game

## Description

The Space Battle is a game that allows a user to control a rocket to shoot spaceships.
The user can move the rocket within a specific zone on the screen using arrow keys and 
press SPACE to fire bullets. The spaceships' fleet moves across and down the screen. Every time
the user destroys a spaceship, they get a certain number of points.

## Difficulty

Every time the user destroys all spaceships, the difficulty of the game increases. Specifically,
a new fleet appears that moves faster than the first one, and
the number of points that the user gets for destroying each ship increases. 

## Scoring

The game keeps track and displays the current number of points that the user has, the highest score so far, the difficulty
of the game and the number of lives that the user has. 

## Game Over

The user starts with 3 lives. After the user runs out of lives, it is game over, the highest score is recorded and displayed,
and the user can begin a new game to achieve the higher score.

The user loses a life if a spaceship touches a rocket or reaches the bottom of the screen.
